## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- TypeScript
- Vite

### What I Learned

My goal during this project was to get a hang of typescript's syntax and OOP philosophy more than anything. 

### Continued development

Now that I am fairly comfortable on typescript, I'm looking forward to building a Single Page Application using a framework.
Regarding this project, there is still some styling undone, such as the input range and the checkboxes as well as the crypting effect that you  can notice on the original application.
